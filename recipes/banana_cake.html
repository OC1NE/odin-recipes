	<h2>Scrumptious & Irresistably Delicious</h2>
	<p>This banana cake recipe uses freshly mashed bananas as well as buttermilk, resulting in a very moist cake packed with banana flavor! I first came across this recipe on 
		<a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8333/banana-cake-vi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>All Recipes</strong></a>. All credits to <em>Cindy Carnes</em>, the original poster of the recipe, as well as her friend who made this cake for her during a visit, After she had delivered her 11th child!
